I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Junhyong Kim](https://kim.bio.upenn.edu/). My research interests center around single-cell genomics. I am currently working on robust transformation on scRNA-seq data to make the observations biological comparable. 

I am also working on a [reading list](https://publish.obsidian.md/single-cell-papers/README) about Single-cell genomics. 

I am a incoming senior data scientist intern at IBM Chief Analytics Office for 2021 summer.
