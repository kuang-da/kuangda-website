I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Junhyong Kim](https://kim.bio.upenn.edu/). My research interests center around single-cell genomics. I am currently working on robust objective optimization in biology problems. 

I am also working on a [reading list](https://publish.obsidian.md/single-cell-papers/README) about Single-cell genomics. This list aims to help computational background students like me get familiar with the field while keeping up with the trends.

I am a [Tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku) reader who tends to collect more books than I could ever finish. Here is a on-going [list of my book collection](https://www.notion.so/kuangda/e510f753fbeb4c7fab65aae19e22d073?v=f8b214cd7f584da5b7d3846f40224cae).

I interned at IBM Chief Analytics Office as a senior data scientist in the 2021 summer.
