## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Junhyong Kim](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/junhyong-kim). My research focuses on deep learning and single-cell genomics, with a specific emphasis on reconstructing cell lineage trees using metric learning. Here is our [recent preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13925) on this topic.

I am funded by The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program ([HuBMAP](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01194-w)) to develop [computational frameworks](https://github.com/kimpenn/aegle) for analyzing spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data across organs and donors for Female Reproductive System.

Beyond my primary research, I have contributed to several projects in computational biology, including: [üìê](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QLydjLdcFV) Developing a robust normalization method for single-cell RNA-seq data ; [üåÄ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022283622002789) Learning from an empirical kernel space for efficiently predicting protein folding; [üìà](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/drug-delivery/articles/10.3389/fddev.2024.1359700/full) Time-series analysis of cellular phototransfection responses. I am also passionate about building data science tools to facilitate collaborative research.

I was fortunate to intern as a Senior Data Scientist at IBM‚Äôs Chief Analytics Office.

**I am actively looking for opportunities as a Research Scientist in AI4Science at industry labs or biotech. Please feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to connect!**
